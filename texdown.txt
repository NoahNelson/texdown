TeXdown - a markdown language for math.

Things that bug me about LaTeX/wishlist:

- phonetic name
- less intrusive math-mode character
    - can be the same inline and block mode with clever processing
- unicode support
- easier variable definitions

Todo:

- substitute inline backticks for $ and backticks beginning a math block with
  \[ and \], unless matched with '.
- convert some basic LaTeX files into this new form and see if it actually
  makes a difference.

This tool should also write the header garbage I need. It could even write
\usepackage for me based on what's in the file.
